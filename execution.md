**Trading Plan: AMZN Breakout Strategy**

**Assumptions:**

*   Current Price: $193 (approximate)
*   Analyst Consensus: Strong Buy
*   Average Price Target: $247.11
*   Strategy: Breakout trading, adapting principles from general strategies for trading at all-time highs.

**1. Breakout Progress:**

*   **Phase:** Given the 'Strong Buy' consensus and the price trending upwards, we can assume AMZN is in the **action** or **resolution** phase of an uptrend. A breakout strategy is most effective in the resolution phase, where the price breaks through resistance levels.

**2. Pattern Structure:**

*   **Analysis:** Analyze the recent price action for bullish patterns (e.g., ascending triangle, cup and handle) or bearish patterns (e.g., double top) that may invalidate the breakout. A period of consolidation near the $193 level would be a bullish sign, suggesting accumulation before a breakout. Without real-time chart analysis, I'll assume a constructive consolidation pattern.

**3. Resistance Levels:**

*   **Identification:**
    *   **Initial Target:** The analyst price target of $247.11 serves as the primary profit target.
    *   **Fibonacci Extensions:** To identify potential hidden resistance, we need to define a swing high and swing low. Without real-time data, let's hypothetically assume a recent swing low at $175 and a swing high at $195.
        *   Using a Fibonacci extension calculator, project levels beyond $195 based on the $175-$195 range. Key levels to watch would be the 161.8% extension (approximately $227.40) and the 261.8% extension (approximately $24

**Risk Analysis Report: AMZN Breakout Strategy**

**Date:** May 10, 2025

**1. Market Volatility Risk**

*   **Description:** Unexpected market-wide events (e.g., economic data releases, geopolitical tensions) can lead to increased volatility, causing the breakout to fail or reverse sharply. Even with a "Strong Buy" consensus, broader market downturns can negatively impact AMZN's price.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Position Sizing:** Use smaller position sizes to limit potential losses.
    *   **Stop-Loss Orders:** Implement tight stop-loss orders below the breakout level to protect capital. Consider a stop-loss order slightly below the assumed swing low of $175 or a recent support level.
    *   **Volatility Monitoring:** Closely monitor market volatility using indicators like the VIX. Reduce exposure during periods of high volatility.

**2. False Breakout Risk**

*   **Description:** The price may temporarily break above the resistance level ($193), only to fall back below it shortly after. This can trigger stop-loss orders and result in losses.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Confirmation:** Wait for confirmation of the breakout before entering a position. This could involve waiting for the price to close above the resistance level for a specified period (e.g., one or two trading days) or looking for increased volume on the breakout.
    *   **Price Action Analysis:** Analyze the price action around the breakout level. Look for strong bullish candles and avoid entering if there are signs of hesitation or rejection.

**3. Unexpected News Events Risk**

*   **Description:** Unforeseen company-specific news (e.g., negative earnings reports, regulatory changes, management issues) can significantly impact AMZN's stock price, potentially invalidating the breakout strategy.
